dogfood (working title)

the lightest web-browser ever.

this is a simple python wrapper on WebKit/GTK+.

plugins are turned off because flash freezes up webkit on my box.

keyboard acceleration:

  C-l focus the location bar, select all (Enter, of course, initiates
      navigation)
  C-w close the current window
  C-q quit the application, closing all open windows in this process
  C-p previous page (history back)
  C-n next page (history forward)

see the file thoughts for what needs to happen next.
