dogfood (working title)

the lightest web-browser ever.

this is a simple python wrapper on WebKit/GTK+.

plugins are turned off because flash freezes up webkit on my box.

keyboard acceleration:

  C-l select the location bar
  C-w close the current window
  C-q quit the application
  C-p previous page (history back)
  C-n next page (history forward)
  C-' select the statusbar to enter commands
  C-f select the statusbar with '/' entered as a command already

right now the only command implemented is "/text" to search for text; hit
enter to keep searching to the next match.

going forward (in no particular order):

* hotkey "open this in kaz" (just in case)

* completion on the url entry
  this requires keeping some sort of history, which I'm slightly opposed to

* tabs (maybe)

* bookmarks (maybe) or tight integration with some sort of online bookmarks
  service (most likely my own)

* quick "store this search as a keyword" cuz I like that functionality, and
  the current way is a pain in the butt

* session (remember where I left off)

* C rewrite (gains what? I'll probably never finish)

* get backspace working correctly (so when an Entry has focus, backspace
  doesn't go to the previous page)

* better error handling (as in some, at all)

* vala version doesn't work at Yukon
  on an eth connection?
  python version works fine?
