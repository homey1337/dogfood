* hotkey "open this in kaz" (just in case)

* completion on the url entry
  this requires keeping some sort of history, which I'm slightly opposed to

* reload is still meaningless, since it's all cached on the proxy. maybe
  this will become a problem? learn how to flush squid's cache...

* tabs (maybe)

* bookmarks (maybe) or tight integration with some sort of online bookmarks
  service (most likely my own)

* quick "store this search as a keyword" cuz I like that functionality, and
  the current way is a pain in the butt

* session (remember where I left off)

* C rewrite (gains what? I'll probably never finish)

* downloads (partially working)

* more powerful statusbar, showing each object "in progress" and percentage
  to completion... all loading frames, all downloading files.
