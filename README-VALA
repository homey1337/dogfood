Wow. So much potential.

Weirdness:

* sometimes this doesn't work (only at Yukon, wtf?)

* plugins work for Vala but not Python

* the Vala crew still doesn't have the right signature for
  hovering_over_link ... I care less and less as I head toward porting
  vimperator

* no DOM access (grrr) ... except that I can execute arbitrary javascript
  (hmm)
